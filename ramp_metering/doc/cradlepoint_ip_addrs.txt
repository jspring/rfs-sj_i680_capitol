Caltrans also sets the netmask, gateway, and broadcast addresses.  The netmask is 255.255.255.0.  The gateway and broadcast addresses contain the first three octets as the IP address (i.e. 172.25.3 in all of the above cases), and the last octet is 001 for gateway and 255 for broadcast.  This means, for all of the above Caltrans IP addresses:

Gateway: 172.25.3.1
Broadcast: 172.25.3.255
